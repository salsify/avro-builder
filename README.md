# Avro::Builder

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/salsify/avro-builder.svg?branch=master)][travis]
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/avro-builder.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/avro-builder)

[travis]: http://travis-ci.org/salsify/avro-builder

`Avro::Builder` provides a Ruby DSL to create [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/) Schemas.

This DSL was created because:
* The [Avro IDL](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/idl.html) is not supported in Ruby.
* The Avro IDL can only be used to define Protocols.
* Schemas can be extracted as JSON from an IDL Protocol but support
  for imports is still limited.

Additional background on why we developed `avro-builder` is provided
[here](http://blog.salsify.com/engineering/adventures-in-avro).

## Features
* The syntax is designed for ease-of-use.
* Definitions can be imported by name. This includes auto-loading from a configured
  set of paths. This allows definitions to split across files and even reused
  between projects.
* Record definitions can inherit from other record definitions.
* [Schema Store](#schema-store) to load files written in the DSL and return
  `Avro::Schema` objects.

## Limitations

* Only Avro Schemas, not Protocols are supported.
* See [Issues](https://github.com/salsify/avro-builder/issues) for functionality
  that has yet to be implemented.
* This is beta quality code. There may be breaking changes until version 1.0 is
  released.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'avro-builder'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install avro-builder

## Railtie

When included in a Rails project, `#{Rails.root}/avro/dsl` is configured as a
load path for the DSL.

A [rake task](#avro-generate-rake-task) is also defined for generating Avro JSON
schemas from the DSL.

## Usage

To use `Avro::Builder`, define a schema:

```ruby
namespace 'com.example'

fixed :password, 8

enum :user_type, :ADMIN, :REGULAR

record :user do
  required :id, :long
  required :user_name, :string
  required :type, :user_type, default: :REGULAR
  required :pw, :password
  optional :full_name, :string
  required :nicknames, :array, items: :string
  required :permissions, :map, values: :bytes
end
```

The schema definition may be passed as a string or a block to
`Avro::Builder.build`.

This generates the following Avro JSON schema:
```json
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "user",
  "namespace": "com.example",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "id",
      "type": "long"
    },
    {
      "name": "user_name",
      "type": "string"
    },
    {
      "name": "type",
      "type": {
        "name": "user_type",
        "type": "enum",
        "symbols": [
          "ADMIN",
          "REGULAR"
        ],
        "namespace": "com.example"
      },
      "default": "REGULAR"
    },
    {
      "name": "pw",
      "type": {
        "name": "password",
        "type": "fixed",
        "size": 8,
        "namespace": "com.example"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "full_name",
      "type": [
        "null",
        "string"
      ],
      "default": null
    },
    {
      "name": "nicknames",
      "type": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": "string"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "permissions",
      "type": {
        "type": "map",
        "values": "bytes"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Required and Optional

Fields for a record are specified as `required` or `optional`. Optional fields are
implemented as a union in Avro, where `null` is the first type in the union and
the field has a default value of `null`.

### Named Types

`fixed` and `enum` fields may be specified inline as part of a record
or as standalone named types.

```ruby
# Either syntax is supported for specifying the size
fixed :f, 4
fixed :g, size: 8

# Either syntax is supported for specifying symbols
enum :e, :X, :Y, :Z
enum :d, symbols: [:A, :B]

record :my_record_with_named do
  required :f_ref, :f
  required :fixed_inline, :fixed, size: 9
  required :e_ref, :e
  required :enum_inline, :enum, symbols: [:P, :Q]
end
```

### Complex Types

Array, maps and unions can each be embedded within another complex type using
methods that match the type name:

```ruby
record :complex_types do
  required :array_of_unions, :array, items: union(:int, :string)
  required :array_or_map, :union, types: [array(:int), map(:int)]
end
```

Methods may also be used for complex types instead of separately specifying the
type name and options:

```ruby
record :complex_types do
  required :array_of_unions, array(union(:int, :string))
  required :array_or_map, union(array(:int), map(:int))
end
```

For more on unions see [below](#unions).

### Nested Records

Nested records may be created by referring to the name of the previously
defined record or using the field type `:record`.

```ruby
record :sub_rec do
  required :i, :int
end

record :top_rec do
  required :sub, :sub_rec
end
```

Definining a subrecord inline:

```ruby
record :my_rec do
  required :nested, :record do
    required :s, :string
  end
end
```

Nested record types defined without an explicit name are given a generated
name based on the name of the field and record that they are nested within.
In the example above, the nested record type would have the generated name
`__my_rec_nested_record`:

```json
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "my_rec",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "nested",
      "type": {
        "type": "record",
        "name": "__my_rec_nested_record",
        "fields": [
          {
            "name": "s",
            "type": "string"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Unions

A union may be specified within a record using `required` and `optional` with
the `:union` type:

```ruby
record :my_record_with_unions do
  required :req_union, :union, types: [:string, :int]
  optional :opt_union, :union, types: [:float, :long]
end
```

For an optional union, `null` is automatically added as the first type for
the union and the field defaults to `null`.

Unions may also be defined using the `union` method instead of specifying the
`:union` type and member types separately:

```ruby
record :my_record_with_unions do
  required :req_union, union(:string, :int)
  optional :opt_union, union(:float, :long)
end
```

### Logical Types

The DSL supports setting a logical type on any type except a union. The logical
types defined in the Avro [spec](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.8.1/spec.html#Logical+Types)
are more limited.

The official Ruby `avro` gem does not yet support logical types:
[AVRO-1695](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-1695).

There is a `avro-salsify-fork` gem released from this
[fork](https://github.com/salsify/avro) that includes changes to support
encoding and decoding logical types. To use this gem, reference it in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'avro-salsify-fork', require: 'avro'
```

A logical type can be specified for a field using the `logical_type` attribute:

```ruby
record :with_timestamp
 required :created_at, :long, logical_type: 'timestamp-micros'
end
```

Primitive types with a logical type can also be embedded within complex types
using either the generic `type` method:

```ruby
record :with_date_array
  required :date_array, :array, type(:int, logical_type: date)
end
```

Or using a primitive type specific method:

```ruby
record :with_date_array
  required :date_array, :array, int(logical_type: date)
end
```

### Type Macros

`avro-builder` allows type macros to be defined that expand to types that
cannot normally be named in Avro schemas. These macro names are not retained
in generated schemas but allow definitions to be reused across DSL files:

```ruby
type_macro :timestamp, long(logical_type: 'timestamp-millis')

record :user do
  required :created_at, :timestamp
  required :updated_at, :timestamp
end
```

Type macros inherit the namespace from the context where they are defined or
an explicit namespace option may be specified:

```ruby
type_macro :timestamp, long(logical_type: 'timestamp-millis'),
           namespace: 'com.my_company'
```

### Auto-loading and Imports

Specify paths to search for definitions:

```ruby
Avro::Builder.add_load_path('/path/to/dsl/files')
```

Undefined references are automatically loaded from a file with the same name.
The load paths are searched for `.rb` file with a matching name.

Files may also be explicitly imported using `import <filename>`.

### Extends

A previously defined record may be referenced in the definition of another
record using `extends <record_name>`. This adds all of the fields from
the referenced record to the current record. The current record may override
fields in the record that it extends.

## Schema Store

The `Avro::Builder::SchemaStore` can be used to load DSL files and return cached
`Avro::Schema` objects. This schema store can be used as the schema store for
[avromatic](https://github.com/salsify/avromatic)
to generate models directly from schemas defined using the DSL.

The schema store must be initialized with the path where DSL files are located:

```ruby
schema_store = Avro::Builder::SchemaStore.new(path: '/path/to/dsl/files')
schema_store.find('schema_name', 'my_namespace')
#=> Avro::Schema (for file at '/path/to/dsl/files/my_namespace/schema_name.rb')
```

To configure `Avromatic` to use this schema store and its Messaging API:

```ruby
Avromatic.configure do |config|
  config.schema_store = Avro::Builder::SchemaStore.new(path: 'avro/dsl')
  config.registry_url = 'https://builder:avro@avro-schema-registry.salsify.com'
  config.build_messaging!
end
```

### Avro Generate Rake Task

There is a rake task that can be used to generate Avro schemas from all DSL
files.

A rake task is automatically defined via a Railtie for Rails projects that uses
`#{Rails.root}/avro/dsl` as the root for Avro DSL files.

Custom rake tasks can also be defined:

```ruby
require 'avro/builder/rake/avro_generate_task'
Avro::Builder::Rake::AvroGenerateTask.new(name: :custom_gen,
                                          dependencies: [:load_app]) do |task|
  task.root = '/path/to/dsl/files'
  task.load_paths << '/additional/dsl/files'
end
)
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
